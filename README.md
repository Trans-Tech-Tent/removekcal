# Remove KCal

A web extension for removing calorie counts from food websites, aimed at those who struggle with disordered eating triggered by calorie counts.

Currently a debug Firefox extension using a (non-exhaustive) whitelist of UK food delivery services that are tested to not break.


TO DO:
<ul>
  <li>Package Firefox version for easier browser import</li>
  <li>Create Google Chrome version</li>
  <li>Expand whitelist (alternatively optimise code so that a whitelist is not needed)</li>
</ul>
